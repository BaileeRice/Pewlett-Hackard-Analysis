# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
OVERVIEW:

The basis of this project is to deliver retirement metrics and work statistics from a large pool of data for Pewlett-Hackard, notably projected retirement dates and workers eligiblity for programs.

RESULTS:

-The retirement_titles table represents the employees that are eligible for retirement and their associating positions within the company, as well as their hire-on date and if they're actively still working.

-The unique_titles table contains an updated version of every workers job title(as they may have recieved a promotion) and rules out multiple instances of a workers name(as they may have more than one job).

-retiring_titles tallies up each potential retiree and categorizes them by their positions, 'Senior Engineers' and 'Senior Staff' making up the main portion of those that will be leaving the company soon(something to look out for).

SUMMARY:

The data shows that around 90,000 workers will be eligible for retirement in the near future, this will leave an obscene amount of vacancies within the company if not dealt with. Their is only around 1,500 workers that apply for the mentorship program after retirement is all said and done, that being said, there is a very slim chance that new hire-ons will have the opportunity to get hands on help from the vets.
